*Note: Right now only works with twitter, and only loads first 40 tweets. 
To improve, need to collect more tweets and extend the crawler to 
other urls (facebook, instagram, google, yahoo, bing... etc).
Running into a problem with automated requesting, google blocks most 
crawlers so need to implement proxy servers to request from.
